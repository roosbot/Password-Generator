## Project Description
I programmed the game TicTacToe because it is a game I used to play a lot when I was younger. Moreover, it is a very visual game and I wanted to learn how to play this game with Python code.

## Rules
Traditionally, TicTacToe is a game with a 3x3 grid that is often played on pen and paper with 2 players (X and O). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner of the game.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
- Checking the rules of the game to make sure I didn't forget any steps
- Writing the project description for as much as I can (description, rules, workflow, organization, links)
- Created a Python workbook in Jupyter Notebook
- I played TicTacToe on websites with the computer to see how it works/looks
- Then I wrote down the game in pseudo-code
- I looked at code I wrote for Rock, Papers and Scissors exercise
- Then I wrote the real code

## Organization
I didn't use a tool like trello or kanban board. 

- How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?
- What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and trello/kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
